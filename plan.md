# OHDSI STROKE

## Approach

This is a very large dataset that deals with many different types of individuals. The first objective would be to create a cohort for those with mental issues. This is similar to what groups did last year but with a different audience. The tools used to create this cohort would be the cohort creator along with ATLAS.

## Stakeholder Involvement

October 1st 11 am meeting:

Communication with other team was made. The teams will be doing similar work from the EDA to the cohort stages of this project. Then after that they will diverge.

Introductions were made with primary contact. We talked about working through the CITI training and getting access to OHDSI. Then we talked about using Python over R with the understanding that commenting will be crucial for understanding. Then we talked about going through Casey's code in order to create a cohort. Then we discussed an inital step by step guide to give the project more of a time line. Lastly we talked about the notebook full of code to generate diagnosises of intrest.
